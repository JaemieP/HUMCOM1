        <b><i>By Nat King Cole</i></b><hr><br>
        <p>Daisy, Daisy<br>Give me your answer do<br>
            I'm half crazy<br>All for the love of you<br>
            It won't be a stylish marriage<br>I can't afford a carriage<br>
            But you'll look sweet<br>Upon the seat<br>
            Of a bicycle built for two</p></center>
